## **Mahesh Babu's Heart Surgery Initiative: The Complete Story**

Mahesh Babu's involvement in funding heart operations for children is one of his most significant philanthropic endeavors, deeply rooted in personal experience and motivated by genuine compassion for children in need.

## **Personal Motivation Behind the Initiative**

The primary motivation for Mahesh Babu's heart surgery program stems from his personal experience when his son **Gautam was born prematurely and had to be treated in the NICU for several days**. This life-changing experience made him acutely aware of the struggles families face when their children require critical medical care, particularly those who cannot afford expensive treatments.[1]

As Mahesh Babu himself explained during the launch of the Pure Little Hearts Foundation: "**Children have always been close to my heart. Ever since Gautam's birth, everybody knows that children are emotional and I've always wanted to help them**". This personal connection transformed his general love for children into a focused mission to help families facing similar medical crises.[2]

## **Scale and Impact of Heart Surgery Support**

Mahesh Babu's foundation has achieved remarkable milestones in pediatric cardiac care:

- **Over 4,500 free heart surgeries** have been funded by the Mahesh Babu Foundation as of 2025[3]
- Initially reached the milestone of **1,000 heart surgeries** through collaboration with Andhra Hospitals[4]
- **Over 2,000 heart surgeries** have been funded in collaboration with Andhra Hospitals and Rainbow Hospitals[1]
- The foundation continues to expand its reach, with Namrata Shirodkar confirming that "**the initiative to provide free heart surgeries for children will continue**"[3]

## **Partnership with Medical Institutions**

### **Pure Little Hearts Foundation (2022)**
In March 2022, Mahesh Babu launched the **Pure Little Hearts Foundation (PLHF)** in partnership with Rainbow Children's Heart Institute (RCHI) in Hyderabad. This initiative specifically targets:[5]
- **Economically-challenged children with congenital heart diseases**
- **125 children initially committed** for critical heart surgery support[6][2]
- Focus on **one-time cardiac interventions** that enable children to lead normal, productive lives

### **Collaboration with Andhra Hospitals**
The foundation has maintained a long-standing partnership with Andhra Hospitals, where specialist teams from around the world have performed surgeries on a voluntary basis. These procedures have been supported by **financial backing from UK-based Healing Little Hearts (HLH) and Mahesh Babu's foundation**.[4]

## **Medical Focus and Scope**

The foundation primarily addresses **congenital heart diseases (CHD)**, which affect **10 out of every 1,000 births in India**, meaning more than **200,000 children are born annually with heart conditions**. Approximately **one-fifth of these infants require intervention within their first year**.[5]

Dr. Nageswara Rao Koneti, chief cardiologist at RCHI, emphasized the urgency: "**At RCHI we have performed nearly 900 cardiac surgeries and over 850 cardiac procedures in the last 2 years, many of them were performed on children less than one-year-old and critically ill**".[5]

## **Recent Case Examples**

### **Pilli Varshita's Story (2025)**
A recent example illustrates the foundation's ongoing impact: **nine-year-old Pilli Varshita from West Godavari, Andhra Pradesh**, was born with a ventricular septal defect. When her father, a painter with limited financial resources, couldn't afford the surgery, the **Mahesh Babu Foundation stepped in and facilitated the critical heart surgery at Andhra Brain and Heart Hospital in Vijayawada**.[7]

## **Philosophical Approach**

Mahesh Babu's approach to pediatric cardiac care is driven by several key beliefs:

1. **"Tiny hearts deserve the greatest care"** - his personal motto for the initiative[8]
2. **One-time intervention philosophy**: As Dr. Ramesh Kancharla from Rainbow Children's Hospital noted, "**cardiac treatment for children is like a one-time fix. These children, once treated, are like any normal person and contribute positively to the growth of the country**"[5]
3. **Equity in healthcare**: The foundation addresses the reality that families of most affected children "**are unable to afford quality children's cardiac care, leading to significant morbidity and mortality**"[8]

## **Ongoing Commitment**

As part of his broader philanthropic strategy, Mahesh Babu **donates 30% of his annual income (approximately ₹30 crore) to various charitable causes**, with pediatric cardiac care being a primary focus. The foundation's mission statement emphasizes providing "**financial aid to infants from underprivileged families and children with cardiac issues and help them undergo life saving surgery**".[9][1]

Through this comprehensive heart surgery program, Mahesh Babu has transformed his personal experience as a father into a systematic effort to save thousands of young lives, making pediatric cardiac care accessible to families who would otherwise be unable to afford it.
